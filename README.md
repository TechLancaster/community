## Code of Ethics / Conduct
The Lancaster tech community expects that activities, events, and digital forums:

1. Are a safe and respectful environment for all participants.
2. Are a place where people are free to fully express their identities.
3. Presume the value of others. Everyone’s ideas, skills, and contributions have value.
4. Don’t assume everyone has the same context, and encourage questions.
5. Encourage members and participants to listen as much as they speak.
6. Strive to build tools that are open and free technology for public use. Activities that aim to foster public use, not private gain, are prioritized.

## Principles
* Free and Open
* Driven by community not commerce
* Governed by rough consensus

TechLancaster does not endorse any business, product, service, etc.  This allows us to remain neutral and focus on growing the tech community in Lancaster. *Note: the meetup is often sponsored by businesses that donate use of their space, equipment, etc. We acknowledge that it's impossible to remain entirely neutral in this situation, but rely on the community to call us out on anything that crosses the line.*
