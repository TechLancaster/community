#Lancaster Tech Community

This repository is a place for the Lancaster, PA tech community to collaborate
and discuss issues affecting the community and share resources as they're being
developed.

**All of these items are open for discussion! If you don't like something, just 
file an issue or talk to us.**

##TechLancaster
TechLancaster started as a simple local meetup for tech people to come together and geek out. We strive to be open, welcoming, and supportive to everyone in the community, regardless of their interest or background.

The past year has seen amazing growth in Lancaster's tech scene, and we believe this is only the beginning. As members of the tech community, we want to support this growth and ensure the community remains a healthy, open, and welcoming place for all its current and future members.

To that end, we are evolving **TechLancaster** to be more than a meetup.  We hope it can become a unifying banner for Lancaster's tech scene to rally around - where we can come together to continue to share ideas and provide services to Lancaster's tech community at large while remaining neutral - driven solely by and for the community.

The next section outlines some guiding principals we hope to adopt for **TechLancaster**.  There has been some discussion of a **TechLancaster** seal of approval or set of guidelines for meetups - that is not the goal of this document right now.
